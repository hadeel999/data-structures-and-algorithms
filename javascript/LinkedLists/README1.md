# Linked-List Insertions 
Implementation of some linked list insertion functions:


## Whiteboard Process

- `append(value)`

- `insertBefore(targetValue, insertedValue)`

- `insertAfter(targetValue, insertedValue)`

- `kthFormEnd(k)`

- `zipLists`

## Approach & Efficiency
In each one of mentioned functions the worst case was to loop through linked list elements, so I used (while) approach and have an O(n) as time complexity, and O(1) as space complexity because there is no need to additional space.
