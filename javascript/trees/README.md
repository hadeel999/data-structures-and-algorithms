# Trees
A tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

## Challenge
Create `Node`, `BinaryTree` and `BinarySearchTree` classes and create `preOrder()`,`inOrder()`, `postOrder()` to traverse a tree and return it's nodes as an array of their values. Also we should create `add(value)` function to add a node in the correct location in the binary search tree, and `contains(value)` function to check if a value is existed in a binary search tree or not.

## Approach & Efficiency
For `preOrder()`,`inOrder()` and `postOrder()` functions, we needed O(n) as a time complexity because traversing through nodes needs to keep tacking of the last visited node. 

For `add(value)` and `contains(value)` functions, we needed O(log(n)) as a time complexity because inserting and searching in a Binary Search Tree depends on the tree's height which equals to log(n).

## API
- `preOrder()`: Traverse a tree >> root, left, right.
- `inOrder()`: Traverse a tree >> left, root, right.
- `postOrder()`: Traverse a tree >> left, right, root.
- `add(value)`: Add a node in the correct location in the binary search tree.
- `contains(value)`: Check whether or not the value is in the binary search tree at least once.
