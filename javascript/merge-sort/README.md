# Challenge Summary
Trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

Once you are done with your article, code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort.

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
- Time Complexity: O(nlog(n)) Because mergeSort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves.
- Space Complexity: O(n) Because of using space in storing the array's elements.

## Solution
See [merge-sort.test](./__tests__/merge-sort.test.js) file.
