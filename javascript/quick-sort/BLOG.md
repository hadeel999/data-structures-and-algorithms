Like Merge Sort, **QuickSort** is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways. 

- Always pick the first element as a pivot.
- Always pick the last element as a pivot.
- Pick a random element as a pivot.
- Pick median as the pivot.

The key process in quickSort is a `partition()`. The target of partitions is, given an array and an element x of an array as the pivot, put x at its correct position in a sorted array and put all smaller elements (smaller than x) before x, and put all greater elements (greater than x) after x. All this should be done in linear time.
